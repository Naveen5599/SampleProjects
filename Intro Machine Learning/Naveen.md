MACHINE LEARNING::==


--> In machine learning machine is trained to automatically predict and to give accurate values.

--> The properties of the given data is called as FEATURES.And also other dimensions also there like PREDICTORS or variables.

--> We can differentiate the data with boundaries,which are may be linear or non-linear.

--> Creating a data model with machine is called is TRAINING a model.

--> One example of a machine learning method is a DECISSION TREE.

--> In machine learning IF,THEN statements are called as FORK statements.

--> And the splitted data into two groups is called BRANCHES.

--> The values in between the two branches and on the boundary are called as SPLIT POINT.These split points are a version of boundaries		 of a decission tree.

--> The data that is misclassified is called as FALSE NEGATIVES.

--> The split that covers each and everything about a branch of classified data is called as FALSE POSITIVES.

--> If the result of the each branch is pure one, then it is called as BEST SPLIT.

--> Split points are added again and again in a repetition manner which is called as RECURSION.

--> If the branches are splitted according to more fork additional forks will give more accuracy about the data.

--> Dividing the data into branches based on forks will make a tree like structure called Decission tree.

--> The data that is used to train the decission tree is called training data.

--> The data that is given to machine to test the decission tree is called as TEST DATA.

--> Machine may do errors beacause of training it over,this is called as OVERFITTING.

-->Machinelearning is of three types:=
					- Supervised learning: In this machine is trained well and and judged by human whether it is doing correct or wrong.
					- Reinforced learning: In this Machine only judged by the human whether it is doing correct or wrong.
					- Unsupervised learning: In this human gives only data.
