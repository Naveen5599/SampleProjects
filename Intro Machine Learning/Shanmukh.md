Machine Learning:
Machine learning is a process where we teach the machine to act for a particular situation by designing some algorithms for it.
Based upon these algorithms the machine learns how to handle and how to solve a particular problem.
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
Some machine learning methods:

Machine learning algorithms are often categorized into supervised,unsupervised,reinforcement 

Supervised Learning: Machine learning algorithms can apply what has been learned in the past to new data using labeled examples to predict future events. Starting from the analysis of a known training dataset, the learning algorithm produces an inferred function to make predictions about the output values. The system is able to provide targets for any new input after sufficient training. The learning algorithm can also compare its output with the correct, intended output and find errors in order to modify the model accordingly.

Unsupervised Learning: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms are used when the information used to train is neither classified nor labeled. Unsupervised learning studies how systems can infer a function to describe a hidden structure from unlabeled data. The system doesnâ€™t figure out the right output, but it explores the data and can draw inferences from datasets to describe hidden structures from unlabeled data.

Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement machine learnign alogirthms are used when the information used to train is not given to the machine but in turn judges the machine according to its action whether its acting right or wrong.Here the machine is left to explore the data and act according to its will irrespective of the output.

Visual introduction to Machine Learning:
In Machine learning computers apply statiscal pattern matching algorithms to data and then defines a specific output for the data given to the machine.
They automaticaly identifes the patterns present in the data and the data is processed according to the patterns. These patterns and predictons give highly accurate data.
The data is first processed under a 2D processing patter and the X and Y co-ordinates are obtained after the processing and in order to convert the 2D pattern to 3D pattern another dimension is added which is called as "Nuance".
Then the boundaries are added to the patterns of statistical data using mathematics which is the essence of statistical learning.
The datasets are then used to create the models and creating models are known as training a model.
Finding patterns in data is where machine learning comes in. Machine learning methods use statistical learning to identify boundaries. 
Decision tree is one of the methods where each and every variable is looked up at a time which are easily accesible using this method in machine learning.This decision tree uses if-then statements to recognize patterns in data.These statements are called forks and are used to divide the data into different braches based upon some value associated with the data.
Splitting every layer deeper and deeper increases the accuracy of the result to be obtained.The branches and several layers are added in order to obtain 100% accuracy.
