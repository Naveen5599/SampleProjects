 MACHINE LEARNING:
 
    Machine learning is the current application of AI based on the idea that we should make up machines to learn and access the data themselves. Machine learning focuses on the design of systems that can learn from and make decisions and predictions based on data. Machine learning enables computers to act and make data-driven decisions.It explores the study and construction of algorithms which can learn  and make predictions of data.They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results.Machine learning is so pervasive today that you probably use it dozens of times a day without knowing it.

It is mainly categorized into three types:
1. Supervised learning 
2. Unsupervised learning
3.reinforcement learning
 
Supervised Learning: Supervised learning needs a data analyst to give input and get an desired output.The purpose of this method is for the algorithm to be able to “learn” by comparing its actual output with the “taught” outputs to find errors, and modify the model accordingly. Supervised learning therefore uses patterns to predict label values on additional unlabeled data.A common use case of supervised learning is to use historical data to predict statistically likely future events. It may use historical stock market information to anticipate upcoming fluctuations, or be employed to filter out spam emails. 

Unsupervised learning: Unsupervised learning is commonly used for transactional data. You may have a large dataset of customers and their purchases, but as a human you will likely not be able to make sense of what similar attributes can be drawn from customer profiles and their types of purchases.he goal of unsupervised learning may be as straightforward as discovering hidden patterns within a dataset, but it may also have a goal of feature learning, which allows the computational machine to automatically discover the representations that are needed to classify raw data.

Reinforcement learning: It involves models iterating over many attempts to complete a process. Steps that produce favorable outcomes are rewarded and steps that produce undesired outcomes are penalized until the algorithm learns the optimal process.

Visual introduction to machine learning:
Statistical learning techniques are applied to computers to automaically identify patterns in data and these techniques can be used to make accurate  predictions.In machine learning,statements are called forks, and they split the data into two branches based on some value.That value between the branches is called a split point. Visual learning can be known as learning through graphs,diagrams, visual data,maps,charts etc. There are decision tree tools used for a model of decisionsand their possible consequences.
